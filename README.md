OpenShift is an enabler for microservice architectures, while also supporting more traditional workloads. Many organizations will also find OpenShift native features sufficient to enable a DevOps process, while others will find it is easy to integrate with both standard and custom Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment tools.

The Open Shift architecture employs master servers that manage node servers that run applications as containers.

OpenShift provides additional authentication, security, scheduling, networking, storage, logging, metrics, and application life-cycle management over default Kubernetes features.

Open Shift provides built-in high availability (HA) for masters and pods
